# Classifying SDSS spectra using Neural Networks
This repository contains the work done as part of the TPVI Master's project at EPFL. 

A fully connect Feed-forward Neural Network (FNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is implemented to classify spectra from SDSS III and IV, into galaxies, quasars and other astrophysical objects. Gravitationally lensed galaxies hold abundant knowledge in understanding the expansion of the universe and studying galaxy properties. This project aims to develop techniques using Neural Networks (NN) to make it possible to detect such lensed spectra.
